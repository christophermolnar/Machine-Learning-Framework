
Creating Examples
1- Create Example Format
	-Click Example -> Create
	-Enter how many Single number values you want (0,N) click okay
	-Enter how many Coordinate Points you want (can be 1D-ND) (0, N) click okay
	-Enter how many Text values you want (0, N) click okay
	-For each Num you entered you can choose the Comparison Method (Difference or Polar)
	-For each Coordinate Point you entered you can choose the Comparison Method (Euclidean or Difference)
	-Format for your example is now set up
	-Can click cancel or Exit to quit out of making the examples format
2- Create Training Examples
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Fill in your training example with the desired input for each attribute (click okay to go to next attribute)
	-Can click cancel or Exit to quit out of making the examples format
3- Create Testing Example
	-Click Example -> Add -> Testing
	-Fill in your training example with the desired input for each attribute (click okay to go to next attribute)
	*Input testvalue into the attribute you want to test kNN on
	-Can click cancel or Exit to quit out of making the examples format
4- Calculate kNN
	-Once the Example Format is created and the desired Training Examples and Testing Example are set up
	-Click Example -> Calculate
	-Select the value of k for kNN 
5- Display Results 
	-Once Calculate is clicked it should display the results for the created example
	-Shows the average value of testvalue using all of the kNN
	-Shows the kNN objects in order

Tips:
- Entering Data:
	-Single numbers: $500,000 will be entered as 500000
	-Coordinate: point (25, 20) will be entered as 25,20
	-Text value: "new" will be entered as new
	-The keyword "none" can be used to fill in fields as blanks	
- Testing Example:
	-When choosing the attribute you want to test for enter testvalue

Test Example (House):
1- Create House Format:
	-Click Example -> Create
	-Enter 2 for the amount of Single number points (House sqrft and House price)
	-Enter 1 for Coordinate Point (House Coordinate)
	-Enter 1 for Text Value (House Age)
	-Select Difference Comparison Method (num 1)
	-Select Difference Comparison Method (num 2)
	-Select Euclidean Comparison Method (point)
2- Create Training Houses:
	-Create House1
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Enter 1200
	-Enter 500000
	-Enter 12,25
	-Enter new
	-Create House2
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Enter 1000
	-Enter 300000
	-Enter 10,50
	-Enter old
	-Create House3
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Enter 800
	-Enter 400000
	-Enter 30,100
	-Enter new
3- Create Testing House:
	-Click Create -> Add -> Testing
	-Enter 1000
	-Enter testvalue (this is the value we want to calculate via kNN)
	-Enter 15,20
	-Enter new
4- Calculate kNN
	-Click Create -> Calculation
	-Enter kNN value
	-Results will be displayed
	-With Testvalue averaged between the k results
