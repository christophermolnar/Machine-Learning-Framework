Scoring: 
	-Take all distances and divide by MAX

	-Point has difference and Euclidean

Solve New Problem:
	-Soccer Problem
	*Need to allow the user to add blank/or nothing to attributes

Error Calculation:
	-Talk to prof/ta
	-Can be like our first attempt at KNN
	-Take the best one for each attribute and divide by total attributes or take the most common

Unit Testing:
	-Add Unit Testing
	
Create Packages:
	-Separate package for MCV
	-package for junit testing
	-package for machine learning
	-Separate project class into 2 (one for 'main' and one for functions)
	
Extra & Clean Up:
	-Add a Attribute that can contain Attributes (feature in a feature) 
	-Delete Num and let Point account for everything
	-Refactor Project class
	-Work on cohesion and coupling
