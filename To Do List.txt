
Updated Objectives:
	
Error Calculation:
	-We are suppose to be able to output the average error of a set of testing data
	-We should discuss this amongst ourselves and maybe with a ta or Babek is we need more calrification
	
Project:
	-Refactor Project into KNNModel
	-Fix the if-else statements in edit
	
TA Comments:
	-Remove find kNN from example and move it to model or give it its own kNN class
	-We must document better (suggests javadoc)

Scoring: * Optional
	-Take all distances and divide by MAX
	-This will make everything between 0 and 1

Extra & Clean Up:
	-Add a Attribute that can contain Attributes (feature in a feature) 
	-Work on cohesion and coupling
	-Does the code smell?
