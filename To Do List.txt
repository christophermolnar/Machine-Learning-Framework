
Updated Objectives:

Final Stuff:
	-Delete Soccer Stuff from project (will save a soccer example as a exported file)
	-I believe Ali said our error calculation was good so that should be fine
	-Refactor the Project class to KNNModel class
	-Check Cohesion and Coupling: Look over all classes make sure they do what they say 
	-Commenting: Ali suggested JavaDoc (Make sure everything is commented)
	-UML 
	-Any other suggested changes


Error Calculation:
	-We are suppose to be able to output the average error of a set of testing data
	-We should discuss this amongst ourselves and maybe with a ta or Babek is we need more calrification
	
Project:
	-Refactor Project into KNNModel
	
TA Comments:
	-Remove find kNN from example and move it to model or give it its own kNN class
	-We must document better (suggests javadoc)

Scoring: * Optional
	-Take all distances and divide by MAX
	-This will make everything between 0 and 1

Extra & Clean Up:
	-Add a Attribute that can contain Attributes (feature in a feature) 
	-Work on cohesion and coupling
	-Does the code smell?
