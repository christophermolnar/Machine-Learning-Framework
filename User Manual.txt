Welcome to the KNN Machine Learning Program

**Creating Examples and Calculating Results**

1- Create Example Format
	At launch main program features are disabled, unlocking these features first requires you to specify Example Data List Attributes
	
	-Click Example -> Create
	
	-Enter Number of 'Single Numeric Values' you want (0,N) --> Click 'OK'
		Example: (1500 SQFT --> Enter 1500)
	
	-Enter Number of 'Coordinate Points' you want (can be 1D-ND) (0, N) --> Click 'OK'
		Example: (Coordinates on a Map: [20,30] --> Enter 20,30)
		
	-Enter Number of 'Text Values' you want (0, N) --> Click 'OK'
		Example: (Color of Object: Blue --> Enter 'Blue')

	-Pick a Comparison Method for each 'Coordinate Point Value' entered
		- Euclidean --> Compare the vector distance between points
		- Difference --> Compares the absolute relative distance between two points
	
	-For each Number, you entered you can choose the Comparison Method (Difference or Polar)
		- Difference --> Treats selected attribute as a standard numeric
		- Polar --> Treats selected attribute as an angle (360 degrees)
		
	-Example Data List is now set up, you may change the number of attributes by returning to the 'Create' tab. Add and Edit options now available
	
	*ADD/EDIT Features Unlocked*
	
	** You may abort creating Example Data List at any time by clicking 'Cancel' or 'Exit' on any of the creation dialogs **

	
2- Create Training Examples
	Training Examples are required to give the program an understanding of your problem
		**ALL attribute fields must be Filled -- See TIPS section**
		
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	
	-Fill in your training example with the desired input for each attribute (click 'OK' proceed to the next attribute)
		If the current example does not have corresponding data for an attribute enter 'none'
	
	** You may abort creating Example Data List at any time by clicking 'Cancel' or 'Exit' on any of the creation dialogs **
		
		
3- Create Testing Example
	A testing example is required to specify to the program what needs to be calculated
		**ALL attribute fields must be Filled -- See TIPS section**
	
	-Click Example -> Add -> Testing
	
	-Fill in your training example with the desired input for each attribute (click 'OK' proceed to the next attribute)
		If the current example does not have corresponding data for an attribute enter 'none'; to set a specified test value enter 'testvalue'
	
	** You may abort creating Example Data List at any time by clicking 'Cancel' or 'Exit' on any of the creation dialogs **
	
	
4- Calculate kNN
	**Calculate Functionality is locked until at least one testing and training example is added
	
	-Click Example -> Calculate
	
	-Select the value of Nearest Neighbors you wish to find (MAX = # of Training Examples)
	
	-Results will print at the bottom of the terminal, Calculation may be re-run if desired (Ex. Changing number of Nearest Neighbors)
	
	**An Error will prompt if the dimensions of 'Coordinate Point Value' column attributes are not matching, please check your data and use the 'EDIT' option to fix conflicting data**
	

TIPS:	
- Entering Data:
	-Single numbers: $500,000 will be entered as 500000
	
	-Coordinate: point (25, 20) will be entered as 25,20
	
	-Text value: "new" will be entered as new
	
	-The keyword "none" can be used to fill in fields as blanks	

- Testing Example:
	-When choosing the attribute you wish to calculate enter "testvalue"


EXAMPLE:	
Test Example (House):
1- Create House Format:
	-Click Example -> Create
	-Enter 2 for the amount of Single number points (House sqrft and House price)
	-Enter 1 for Coordinate Point (House Coordinate)
	-Enter 1 for Text Value (House Age)
	-Select Difference Comparison Method (num 1)
	-Select Difference Comparison Method (num 2)
	-Select Euclidean Comparison Method (point)
	
2- Create Training Houses:
	-Create House1
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Enter 1200
	-Enter 500000
	-Enter 12,25
	-Enter new
	-Create House2
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Enter 1000
	-Enter 300000
	-Enter 10,50
	-Enter old
	-Create House3
	-Click Example -> Add -> Training
	-Enter 800
	-Enter 400000
	-Enter 30,100
	-Enter new
	
3- Create Testing House:
	-Click Create -> Add -> Testing
	-Enter 1000
	-Enter testvalue (this is the value we want to calculate via kNN)
	-Enter 15,20
	-Enter new
	
4- Calculate kNN
	-Click Create -> Calculation
	-Enter kNN value
	-Results will be displayed
	-With Testvalue averaged between the k results
