readme - Milestone 2
Group: MZGA - Christopher Molnar, Callum Kirby, Brandon Hartford, and Geoff Scornaienchi

Classes:

Attribute <abstract class>:
-Abstract class for Key, Num and Point

Calculation <interface>:
-Interface for the different types of Calculations

CalculationDifference:
-Calculates the linear distance between numbers

CalculationEuclidian:
-Calculates the Euclidian distance between number or points

CalculationKey:
-Calculate the distance between keys (See if they are the same key)

CalculationPolar:
-Calculate the distance between nums as if they were polar coordinates (angles)

Example:
-Creates Testing and Training Examples

Key:
-Responsible for managing instances of Strings (keys)

KNNController:
-Controls all of the ActionListeners 

KNNView:
-GUI View for out project

Num:
-Responsible for managing instances of integer and floating point value

Point:
-Responsible for managing instances of coordinate values

Project:
-Main class


Changes Made Since Last Deliverable:
-Added a Polar calculation to Num (allows us to calculate polar coordinates/angles)
-Split classes into seperate packages (default, junit Testing, machineLearning, userInterface)
-Added jUnit Testing
-Fixed the edit button
-Multiple calculations can be run now
-Cleaned up the display
-General Refactoring
-Removed dead code 


Future Deliverables:
Milestone 4:
-Add load and save data functions


Known Issues:
-


RoadMap Ahead:
-Add a function to remove all testing and training examples
-Remove all created training and testing examples if they create a new format
-Fix issues addressed by TA
-Communicate with TA and Professor Esfandiari about any questions we have or problems we run into
